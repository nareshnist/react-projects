### ✅ Stage One (Basics)
    - You told me you covered:

    - JSX syntax

    - Rendering variables, lists, conditional elements

    - Passing data to child components

    - children prop

    - Event handling

    - Props destructuring

    - 🔎 From our discussions & your code, I can confirm:

    - You fully understand JSX and how React components render.

    - You can pass props and also fallback to children (like in your Button).

    - You’re comfortable with conditional rendering (ternary, nullish coalescing).

    - You can write simple reusable components with default props.

    - 👉 Stage One = solid. No real gaps. You didn’t miss anything fundamental.

### ✅ Stage Two (Hooks)

    -You said you learned:

    -useState

    -useEffect

    -useRef

    -And from practice:

    -You know how to declare and use state (with initial values).

    -You’ve practiced controlled vs uncontrolled inputs (TextInput, ToggleSwitch).

    -You used useEffect for logging and side effects.

    -You know how to handle event callbacks with state updates.

    -🔎 From my observation:

    -You understand 90–95% of useState basics (updater functions, controlled/uncontrolled).

    -You’ve touched useEffect, but mostly for logging — you haven’t yet explored dependency arrays, cleanup functions, or data fetching patterns.

    -You haven’t used useRef much (good for DOM access, persisting values between renders).

    -👉 Stage Two = very good, but you need more practice on side effects (useEffect) and refs to reach “intermediate React dev” level.
