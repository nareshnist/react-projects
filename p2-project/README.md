###### STEPS PROJECT 

1. Handling Events in the react.
  1. need to write as  Camel-case ex : `onClick, onMouseOver`
  2. never call the function ex handlePrevious() , just declare it otherwise js would execute immediatly.
  3. All functiona name start with `handle` in `React` ,
2. What is `state` in React
    1. define
    2. use 
    3. update it .
    4. only call in top level components like inside components
        1. never call in side the `functions and if else and loops`.
    5. don't change manually
    6. `State is immutable in react`.
    7. Updating state based on current state.
      1. shoud't do directly changing step + 1
      2. call function (s) => s + 1
